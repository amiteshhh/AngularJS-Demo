        No framework whether AngularJS or jQuery can add new capability to the native JavaScript/HTML feature. They simply put abstraction
        layer over the core feature to handle the things in somehow more convinient way. For example
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>$http or $.ajax has been created on the top of native xmlHTTP object to handle ajax call.</li>
            <li>`on` method encapsulated over native `addEventListener` for event binding</li>
        </ul>
